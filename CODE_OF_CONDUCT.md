# Code of Conduct

The SolarPoint code of conduct is derived from the Ruby code of conduct and applies to all collaborative spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, commit comments, and discussions.

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free from personal attacks and disparaging remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behavior that can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

If you believe these guidelines have been violated, you can email Mark Hadjar ([mark.hadjar@solarpointwp.com](mailto:mark.hadjar@solarpointwp.com)).
